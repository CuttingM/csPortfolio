              One problem I had was trying to determine the best way of producing somewhat realistic terrain. In order to do this, I had to use Processing’s noise function, which generates Perlin noise. I used this Perlin noise to get the terrain “height” at each pixel on the screen. From this height, I created a function called getColorFromHeight that returns a color representing the terrain. For example, a height value of less than 0.42 returns a blue color that represents water. Another problem I had was with performance. Getting the noise value and drawing a color at every pixel caused the program to be unbearably slow. I remedied this somewhat by defining a pixelSize, which allowed me to decrease the number of pixels by making them larger on the screen (using Processing’s scale function).
